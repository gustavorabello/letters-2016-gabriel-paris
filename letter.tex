\noindent \textbf{To}: Doctoral School: Applied Mechanics, Energetics,
Materials and Earth Sciences.\\
\noindent \textbf{Subject}: Letter of Recommendation.\\

\noindent Dear Sir or Madam:\\

I am writing this letter for Mr. Gabriel Meletti regarding his work
partially under my orientation at the GESAR lab. I confirm that Mr.
Meletti had been working in the GESAR lab as a master student for about
3 months period and he has moved to the University of Campinas in S\~ao
Paulo to finish his masters. 

I met Mr. Meletti while he was an undergraduate student at the
Mechanical Engineering Department at the State University of Rio de
Janeiro -- UERJ, in 2012. He was an outstanding student, showing
excellent intellectual skills, great interest in research, and ranking
first in his class.

I am aware that Mr. Meletti has followed specific courses to improve his
knowledge in mechanical engineering. In 2015 he has successfully
accomplished one of my graduate courses namelly Multiphase Flow, where
he was able to develop, in a very short period of time, a two-phase
gas-particle turbulent simulator with the knowledge acquired during the
course. I believe mr. Meletti has the basis of a solid education,
preparing him for a successful Ph.D. program. 

While in the GESAR lab, he has taken the opportunity to get well rounded
on different topics beyond his own work, besides his relatively short
period in the lab. In particular, I very much enjoy his social
participation in the GESAR lab, discussing new ideas with colleagues,
supporting lab workspace improvements and helping others with different
tasks. He speaks English very well, he is articulate, and he
is a diligent and motivated person. He has shown good writing skills
while preparing presentations, reports and manuscripts.

In summary, I wish to give my very, very strong recommendation to Mr.
Meletti for his future career in research. I have absolutely no
doubt that he will excel and that we will hear much more from him in the
future.

Yours Faithfully,
